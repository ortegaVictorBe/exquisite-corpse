## Crazy Story
### My Cat Assistant

He is an excellent friend, he became a companion and assistant quickly, finally in three months I managed to get him to accept me, after fortunately having bought him at a local fair for $ 40, his first friend left him abandoned and returned to his country without him, he still misses him but his psychologist is doing that job.

His name is Oliver, he is a British man with long hair, in my house he is in charge of:

+ Do the super
+ Taking out the garbage at the end of the day, sometimes he hides some mice from the garbage in his room to later taste them, there is no problem with it.

*Also is my Best Friend*
